The dominating themes of the course are logic and linear algebra. The goal is to strengthen the ability of students to use mathematical reasoning on the one hand and an algorithmic, computational approach on the other hand, to understand and work with fundamental concepts from linear algebra. The theory is exemplified by thematic exercises. Further, computer software is used to integrate computational and theoretical aspects of the curriculum. ",A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:<br />- use truth tables to investigate statements from propositional logic<br />- use the algebraic and the geometric representation of complex numbers including the complex exponential function<br />- perform computations with polynomials over the complex numbers<br />- apply inductive thinking in mathematical statements<br />- compute/execute a function/algorithm defined in a recursive way<br />- use matrix algebra and Gaussian elimination for solving systems of linear equations and describe their solution sets<br />- analyze linear maps between vector spaces<br />- analyze the eigenvalue problem in particular for square matrices<br />- solve systems of first order linear differential equations with constant coefficients<br />- describe the structure of solutions to a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients<br />- use mathematical terminology and logical reasoning in written presentations<br />- use a computer to execute various algorithms</li></ul>,Propositional logic.

Important statistical principles for collection and analysis of data are introduced, and methods for model choice, estimation, testing and model verification are presented. The participants learn to handle a number of elementary problems which occur frequently in engineering practice and are thus enabled to critically assess statistical (empirical) investigations and references.
